This is a file server written in Python, created since Google Drive does not provide the necessary space for videos for my friends.

[Check out their channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ricebomb) (profanity abound)

## setup
Once everything is downloaded, you'll need to add an initial user with `add_user.py`.

Additionally, you may want to alter `config.toml` to store files in a different directory.

Currently, only `app-flask.py` works.
